	<p>Some highlights of this s chool year were winning NCS for soccer, and making it to NCS in the girls 4x400 in track. At the beggining of the year it was very stressful to apply to college and balance high school academics. However, after all the hard work I succcesfully got into UC San Diego where I will be playing soccer. Ap calculus was my hardest class because math is my weakest subject. Anatomy was one of my favorite classes because of the hands on projects we did.</p>
